I completely agree with what others have said in previous posts about feeling confident during third year clerkships, and suddenly feeling overwhelmed with as many "systems" type of problems as medical problems.
While it has been exciting to be in such a new and fast paced environment it has also been slightly overwhelming.
I can honestly say that watching this code was the most frightening experience I have had in med school so far.
We are now at a point where we are planning another trial extubation, and while I know that this is necessary to complete her treatment and ultimately get her home, I am still very anxious that this may fail again.
I have to say I was a bit overwhelmed during the first few days as I was suddenly responsible for making medical decisions for not just a few of my own patients, but rather a team of 16 patients with whom I was largely unfamiliar.
My first night shift we had three overnight admissions to my team which came in back to back after midnight and a ton of nursing pages about patients on the floor.
I spent all night running back and forth from the team room, to the ED, to the floor and back again.
I barely had my notes and presentations ready in time to present to the morning team at 8AM.
I love and am terrified of this feeling.
These questions, and many more, are plaguing my mind continually.
Handling 6-7 patients on Internal was no big deal, but here I feel overwhelmed taking care of only 2-3.
All the things that just get glossed over in med school, like the details of vent management, pressors, and RRT are suddenly the basis of my managerial decisions and I feel like an early 3rd year again.
