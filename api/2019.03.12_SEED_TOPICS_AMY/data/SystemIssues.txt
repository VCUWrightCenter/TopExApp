For example, learning how to place orders in the ED using their EMR is different than other rotations.
Signing up for patients requires me to first check in as a provider.
My fellow AI and I at St Francis Medical Center Family Medicine have yet to gain access to the EHR (fingers crossed for early this week!).
The two interns on the team do not have access either, so our senior residents are even busier with tasks since none of us can place orders or follow labs/consult notes.
We may not have access to the system, but we listen intently while rounding and running the list and get involved in conversations about differentials and management.
So in response to Dr. Goldberg's question regarding challenges experienced in the AI role, I have found integrating socially and professionally with the team to be relatively easy; however, because I am at a new hospital and waiting on certain technical kinks to be worked out (e.g., still waiting for computer system access and just received badge access today), it has been tough to contribute as much to the team's progress with my patients as I might like.
Nevertheless, it makes completion of core AI objectives less than ideal, since I cannot independently follow up on results, write notes, enter orders, etc.
Is anyone else doing an AI at a new hospital where you don't know your way around; have access to the computer system; etc.?
